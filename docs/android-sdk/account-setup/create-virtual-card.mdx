title: "Create Virtual Card"
---

Once the user is eligible and the SDK is ready, you can initiate the payment method creation process. This step issues the virtual card that enables the Tap & Go payment experience.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the card creation flow, verify that the following conditions are met:

* **Authentication**: The user is authenticated against the CoinBridge SDK.
* **Initialization**: The SDK has completed the initialization process.
* **Eligibility**: You have confirmed the end-user is eligible for CoinBridge services.
* **Check Status**: The initialization callback has returned `HasCard = False`.

## Choose the Creation Flow

The card creation process is handled differently depending on your application's configuration and regional regulations:

* **Automatic Flow**: Triggered automatically by the SDK following a successful initialization.
* **Manual Flow**: Requires the application to explicitly call the `IssueCard` method.

> 💡 **Note:** Consult with your CoinBridge onboarding team to determine which flow applies to your application.

## Start the Process

When initiating the creation process, ensure a smooth user experience by following these guidelines:

### Manage the Waiting Time
The virtual card issuing and provisioning process usually takes up to ten seconds. During this brief interval:
* **Show a Loader**: Display a loader animation with appropriate text notifying the user to wait.
* **Stay in the App**: Inform the user not to leave or close the application until the process is finalized.
* **Automatic Restart**: If the process is aborted (e.g., the user leaves the app), it will automatically restart upon re-entry and initialization.

### Manage Additional Data Requirements
Based on financial regulations in your country, card issuance may require additional user-specific data, such as a **National ID** or **SSN**.
* **Data Payload**: If required, you must include this information as part of the `IssueCard` payload.
* **User Consent**: The SDK may prompt the user to provide details via a dedicated form or consent to additional terms from the issuer.
* **No Additional Data**: If your configuration does not require extra data, the SDK creates the card in the background without further user action.

## Handle the Response

The SDK will return a callback indicating the result of the process.
Once the virtual card issuing flow has been finalized, you will receive a success callback.
* **User Notification**: Congratulate the user and notify them that their device is ready for payments.
* **Next Step**: Redirect the user to finalize the setup through **Provisioning** (adding the card to the device wallet).

## Technical Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```java 
CoinBridgeSDK.getInstance().issueCard(activity, new OnIssueCardCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
        // Notify user and proceed to provisioning
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(CBError<IssueCardError> error) {
        // Handle failure
    }
});
CoinBridge.sharedInstance.issueCard(viewController: self) { result in
    switch result {
    case .onSuccess:
        // Notify user and proceed to provisioning
    case .onError(let error):
        // Handle failure
    }
}
```
