title: "Create Virtual Card"
---

Once a user is eligible and the SDK is ready, you can start creating their virtual card. This is the main step that lets users start making Tap & Go payments.

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating a card, make sure these steps are done:
* **Authentication**: The user is logged in and recognized by the SDK.
* **Initialization**: The SDK has finished its startup check.
* **Eligibility**: You have confirmed the user is allowed to use the service.
* **Check Status**: The initialization result shows `HasCard = False`.

---

## 1. Choose the Issuing Flow

Depending on how your app is set up, the card creation happens in one of two ways:

* **Automatic Flow**: The SDK starts creating the card automatically after initialization finishes.
* **Manual Flow**: Your app starts the process by calling the `IssueCard` method.

> Talk to your CoinBridge onboarding team to find out which flow your app should use.

## 2. Start the Process

When you are ready to create the card, follow these steps to keep the user experience smooth:

### Manage the Waiting Time
Creating a virtual card usually takes up to **10 seconds**. During this time, you must:
* **Show a Loader**: Display a loading animation with a message asking the user to wait.
* **Stay in the App**: Tell the user not to close the app until the process is finished.

### Handle Extra Data Requirements
In some regions, users may need to provide extra information, like a National ID or SSN.
* **If Extra Data is Required**: You must include these details when you call `IssueCard`. 
* **If No Extra Data is Required**: The SDK creates the card in the background without asking the user for anything else.

## 3. Handle the Response

After the process starts, the SDK will send a success or error message.

* **On Success**: Tell the user their card is ready. The next step is to help them add it to their device wallet (provisioning).
* **On Error**: Check the error code to see what happened.
