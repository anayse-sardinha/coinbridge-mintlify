title: "Initialization"
---

The Initialization process synchronizes the SDK with the CoinBridge platform to retrieve the user's specific wallet configuration and card status. This step is mandatory and must be performed after successful authentication before any payment features can be used.

## Prerequisites

Before calling the initialization method, ensure that:
1. The SDK has been successfully authenticated (`isAuthenticated` returns `true`).
2. The device has an active internet connection.

---

## The Initialization Process

### Once the `onAuthenticated` callback is triggered (or if `isAuthenticated` is true), call the initialization method. This pulls the latest card metadata and balance information.

#### Android: Initialization Example
```java
CoinBridgeSDK.getInstance().initialize(context, new OnInitializationCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onInitialized() {
        // Success: The SDK is ready for payment operations
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(CBError<InitError> error) {
        // Handle initialization failure (e.g., network timeout)
    }
});
```
### Initialization States
| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Initialized** | The SDK has successfully synced data. You can now display the virtual card or initiate payments. |
| **Not Initialized** | The SDK is authenticated but lacks local data. UI components will remain in a loading or hidden state. |
