The Authentication (Auth) process connects a user’s unique ID between the **CoinBridge SDK** and the **Back-End Integration**. This link is required to make sure payment data is correctly matched to the right user and their loyalty profile.

## Check Auth Status

To make sure everything works correctly, your app must check the user’s status every time it starts. 

1. **Call the `isAuthenticated`** method when the app opens.
2. **Result**:
    * **If `true`**: The SDK already recognizes the user. You should move on to call the **Initialization** method.
    * **If `false`**: The SDK does not recognize the user or device. You must start the [Authentication Process](#the-authentication-process).

## The Authentication Process

Only start this process if the `isAuthenticated` check returns `false`.

### 1. Prepare the ID
The authentication call must include the user’s unique ID. This ID is used for all future messages between the CoinBridge Back-End and your own loyalty platform.

### 2. Add Eligibility Data
If your region requires extra details to decide if a user can use the service, you must provide that data during the Authentication call. This information is saved in the CoinBridge system to check for service access later.

### 3. Watch for Results
After calling the method, wait for the success or error message (callback). Once you get a successful result, your next step is to call the **Initialization** method.
