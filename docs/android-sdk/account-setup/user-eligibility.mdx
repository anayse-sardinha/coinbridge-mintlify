title: "User Eligibility"
---

The CoinBridge Eligibility Service sets the specific criteria end-users must meet to access CoinBridge payment services. You must verify that a user is eligible before they can subscribe to services or receive a virtual card.

## Overview

Checking eligibility ensures users meet legal and platform rules, such as country of residence, before starting the onboarding process. To provide an optimal user experience and prevent potential frustration, CoinBridge strongly recommends performing this check **before** introducing the solution to the user.

## Prerequisites

Before calling the eligibility method, ensure the following conditions are met:

* **Authentication**: The SDK must be successfully authenticated.
* **Initialization**: The SDK must have finished its startup process.
* **No Existing Card**: The `HasCard` check must return `False`, meaning the user doesn't already have an assigned virtual card.

## How to Check Eligibility

To see if a user is permitted to join, call the `isEligible` method. This is most effective if you do it right after confirming the user has no card (`HasCard = False`) and immediately before invoking the `IssueCard` method.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **Call the Method**: Call the `isEligible` method within your application code.
2.  **Result**:
    * **If Success**: If the method returns `onSuccess`, redirect the user to the onboarding and promotion pages.
    * **If Error**: If you receive an error, you must address the specific reason for ineligibility before the user can access CoinBridge services.

> ### 💡 Tip
> The specific reason for ineligibility is provided through the CoinBridge Backend Connector to your platform.

## Validation

The eligibility check is complete when:
1.  The `isEligible` method returns a successful callback.
2.  Your app successfully transitions the user to the first onboarding and introduction page.
