To use the CoinBridge bridge infrastructure, you must deploy the SDK into your mobile application. Follow these steps to configure your environment and add the SDK for both Android (Gradle) and iOS (Swift Package Manager).

Before starting the integration, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:
| Requirement | Android Specifications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OS Version** | Android 8.0 Oreo (API level 26) or higher  |
| **Development Tool** | Compiled with Android API level 30  |
| **Credentials** | Repository URL and unique credentials (Username and Password)  |
| **Hardware** | NFC-equipped and not rooted |

Follow these steps to configure your private Maven repository and dependencies.
1. Create a `coinbridge.properties` file in your project's root folder and add the credentials provided by the CoinBridge team.
> **Note**: Do not commit this file to source control.
2. In your project-level `build.gradle`, add the private Maven repository:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        maven {
            def cbProperties = new Properties()
            cbProperties.load(new FileInputStream(rootProject.file("coinbridge.properties")))
            url = uri(cbProperties['cbpr.url'])
            credentials {
                username = cbProperties['cbpr.user']
                password = cbProperties['cbpr.password']
            }
        }
    }
}
```
3. Add the SDK and the mandatory `doNotStrip` option to your module-level `build.gradle` file to protect native library integrity.
```gradle
android {
    packagingOptions {
        doNotStrip "*/*/libscm.so"
    }
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.coinbridge:cbsdk:x.y.z' // Replace with required version
}
```
