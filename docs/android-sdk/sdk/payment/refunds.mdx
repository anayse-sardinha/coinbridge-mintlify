title: "Refunds"
---

A refund occurs when a merchant returns funds to a user after a purchase. Refunds are handled as independent transactions within the CoinBridge system and must be reflected accurately in the user's balance and history.

## 1. How Refunds Work

When a merchant processes a refund, the CoinBridge platform receives the data and communicates it to your platform through the **Refund Report Endpoint**.

* **Independent IDs**: Every refund is treated as a new transaction with its own unique Transaction ID.
* **Historical Links**: If the refund is related to a previous purchase, the system will include the **Original Transaction ID** and related details in the report.
* **Positive Values**: The refund amount is always reported as a non-negative (positive) value.
* **Automatic Approval**: The status for a refund transaction reported by CoinBridge is always "Approved".

## 2. Processing a Refund

To ensure the user's account stays accurate, your back-end must perform the following actions when a refund is reported:

1.  **Receive Feedback**: CoinBridge sends the refund data, including the amount and merchant details, to your management platform.
2.  **Top-up Balance**: You must credit (top-up) the user's account balance by the specific refund amount received.
3.  **Record the Event**: Save the refund as an independent entry in your database using its unique ID.

## 3. User Experience & History

It is important to clearly communicate the refund to the user so they understand why their balance has increased.

* **Notifications**: We suggest informing the user that a refund has been processed and their balance has been credited.
* **History Display**: Update the transaction history screen to show the refund. We recommend a message such as: *"You have been refunded the amount of [xx] points"*.
* **Transparency**: If the original transaction ID is available, display it so the user can track which purchase was returned.

## 4. Partial Refunds

In some cases, a merchant may issue a **Partial Refund** for only a portion of the original purchase. 

* These are handled through the **Correction Report Endpoint**.
* Just like a full refund, you must adjust the user's balance based on the positive correction amount received from the system.
