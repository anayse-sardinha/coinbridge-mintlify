title: "Issue Digital Card"
---

The `issueCard` method is the core SDK function that generates the virtual payment card. 

<Info>
Issuing a card is a permanent action intended to happen only once in a user's lifespan. Even if a user reinstalls your app or logs in on a different device, they should never have to issue a new card. In re-login scenarios, use Initialization to retrieve the existing card instead.
</Info>

## Implementation Scenarios
Depending on your country's regulations, this process may occur automatically or require additional user data.

### Scenario 1: No Additional Data Required
CoinBridge creates the card and pushes it to the internal SDK wallet in the background with no further user action.

### Scenario 2: Additional Data Required
You must include user-specific details (e.g., National ID or SSN) as a payload. The user may need to consent to terms via a dedicated form managed by the SDK 

<Note>**Onboarding Tip**: 
You must properly onboard users and explain why this data is needed to ensure a high onboarding rate.</Note>

## Technical Implementation
Call the `issueCard` method from the `CoinBridgeSDK` instance once the user has successfully completed Authentication and Initialization:

```java
CoinBridgeSDK.getInstance().issueCard(activity, new OnIssueCardCallback() {
          @Override
          public void onAbandon() {

          }

          @Override
          public void onShown() {

          }

          @Override
          public void onSuccess() {

          }

          @Override
          public void onError(CBError<IssueCardError> error) {

          }
      });
```

## UX Guidelines
Follow these UX best practices:
* **Loader**: Display a loader with text during the up to 10 seconds card issuance.
* **Retention**: Ensure users stay in the app until the process is complete.
* **Auto Restart**: The process restarts automatically if the user leaves and re-enters the app after SDK re-initialization.
