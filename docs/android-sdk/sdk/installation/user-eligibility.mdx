title: "Check User Eligibility"
---

Before a user can subscribe to CoinBridge services or issue a virtual card, you can have them pass a eligibility check to ensure they meet all financial and regulatory criteria.

## Why Check Eligibility?
You might want to check eligibility for the following reasons:
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures the user meets country-specific regulations, such as residence requirements.
* **KYC Requirements**: Confirms that required "Know Your Customer" data, such as SSN or National ID numbers, is valid.
* **Fraud & Abuse Prevention**: Detects if a user has been blacklisted or flagged for abuse in your system.
* **Prevent Issuance Errors**: Card issuance is a "point of no return". Checking eligibility first prevents attempting to issue a card to a user who the system will ultimately reject.

<Note>**UI Management**:
While optional, calling this method allows you to disable the feature for ineligible users to streamline your user experience.</Note>

## Implementation
The `isEligible` method validates the user. The only requirement is that `initialize` must be called first.

For Android, use the `isEligible` method from the `CoinBridgeSDK` instance:

```java
CoinBridgeSDK.getInstance().isEligible(context, OnIsEligibleCallback onIsEligibleCallback)
```
