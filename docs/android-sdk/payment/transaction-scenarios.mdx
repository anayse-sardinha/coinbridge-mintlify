title: "Transaction Scenarios"
---

The payment journey involves different technical outcomes based on how the user interacts with the terminal and their device. Understanding these scenarios helps you manage app states and provide clear feedback to the user.

---

## Scenario A: Tap Completed (Happy Path)

The "Happy Path" occurs when the device successfully communicates with the merchant's terminal via NFC.

* **Outcome**: The tap process ends with a "Tap Complete" signal. 
* **Important Note**: A successful tap only means information was transmitted; it does not mean the payment has been approved yet. 
* **Next Steps**: The transaction outcome—known as the **Transaction Resolution** (Approved or Declined)—will be sent to your platform shortly after.

## Scenario B: Tap Not Completed (Android Only)

This scenario occurs if something goes wrong during the communication between the device and the EMV terminal.

* **Outcome**: This does **not** mean the transaction was declined. 
* **Cause**: It indicates a technical failure in the communication flow. 
* **User Impact**: If the user taps their device before receiving the "ReadyToPay" signal from the SDK, communication will be blocked, and the terminal will prompt the user to try again.

## Scenario C: Payment Canceled by User

There are cases where the payment process must be aborted before the transaction is finished.

* **Trigger**: The user manually cancels the action (for example, by swiping up to close the app, pressing the home button, or using the "Back" button). 
* **App Trigger**: Your application may decide to stop the payment at a specific stage for security or business logic reasons. 
* **Mandatory Action (Android)**: You must call the `stopPayment` method from the payment activity. 
* **Resetting the State**: To try again after a cancellation, the payment flow must be restarted from the beginning as a new session.

## Scenario D: Payment Timeout

If the SDK is prepared for payment but no tap happens within the set time limit, the session will time out.

* **Effect**: The SDK will no longer be prepared to send data. 
* **Action Required**: The app should inform the user that the session has expired and allow them to restart the payment flow.
