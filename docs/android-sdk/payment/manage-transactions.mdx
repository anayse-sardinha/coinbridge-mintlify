# Manage Transactions

Once a transaction attempt is finished, the CoinBridge platform provides the data needed to manage the user's payment history, handle refunds, and process technical corrections. All transaction results are communicated through the **Back-End Integration** to your loyalty or CRM platform.

## Post-Transaction Communication

After a user taps their device at a terminal, the outcome is determined by the CoinBridge platform in real-time.

* **Transaction Resolution**: The system compares the purchase request against the user's available balance and your specific spending policies.
* **Real-time Updates**: The final decision (Approved or Declined) is transmitted immediately to your back-end for processing.
* **Wallet Notifications**: Users receive instant alerts on their device lock screens, including the merchant name and amount.

## Viewing Transaction History

It is important for users to track their spending. We recommend a dedicated screen within your app to display payment actions.

* **Clear Indicators**: Users must be able to easily tell the difference between approved and declined transactions.
* **Detailed Data**: For each entry, show the transaction amount, merchant name, and timestamp.
* **Decline Explanations**: If a transaction is declined, you must show the reason so the user understands why (e.g., "Amount exceeds maximum allowed").
* **Compliance**: For iOS, transactions made through Apple Wallet must include an indication that they were performed using Apple Pay.

## Handling Refunds and Corrections

Transaction states may change after the initial purchase due to merchant actions or system updates.

### Refunds
* **Process**: A refund occurs when a merchant returns funds to the user. It appears as an independent transaction with its own unique ID.
* **User Balance**: Upon receiving a refund report, you must top-up the user’s balance by the positive refund amount.

### Technical Corrections
A correction is an update to an already approved transaction. These can include:
* **Cancellations**: A transaction initially reported as approved that was actually declined by the network due to timeouts.
* **Settlement Differences**: Occurs when the final amount charged by the merchant is different from the original authorization (e.g., adding a tip at a restaurant).
* **Expirations**: If a merchant does not "settle" the transaction within a specific timeframe, the funds must be returned to the user's balance.

## 4. User Logout
When a user logs out of your app, you must notify the SDK immediately. This triggers the systematic clearance of user-specific payment data from the device to prevent identification errors for the next user.
