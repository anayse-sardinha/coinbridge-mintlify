## Authentication Errors

If the authentication process fails, refer to the table below to handle the specific error returned by the SDK:

| Error Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`INVALID_AUTHENTICATION`** | Authentication failed, typically due to an invalid User ID. |
| **`ALREADY_AUTHENTICATED`** | Not an error. Treat this as a successful call and proceed to Initialization. |
| **`NETWORK_ERROR`** | The SDK could not access the network due to no connectivity or missing permissions. |
| **`GENERAL_ERROR`** | An unknown error occurred. Contact CoinBridge support. |

## Initialization Errors

If the SDK integration is correct, the method is generally failproof. However, you should be prepared to handle the following error values:

| Error Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`SDK_NOT_AUTHENTICATED`** | The SDK must authenticate before it can be initialized. |
| **`DEVICE_NOT_ELIGIBLE`** | The device cannot perform payments (e.g., lacks NFC or is rooted). |
| **`DEVICE_NOT_ELIGIBLE_NO_FOREGROUND_PAYMENT_SETTING`** | The device settings do not allow the currently opened app to perform NFC taps. |
| **`PERMISSIONS_NOT_GRANTED`** | The SDK is missing one or more mandatory system permissions. |
| **`CONFIGURATION_NEEDED`** | The configuration method was not added to the `Application` class `onCreate` method. |
| **`INIT_ALREADY_STARTED`** | Not an error; simply wait for the existing callback to return. |
| **`NETWORK_ERROR`** | No internet connectivity or the SDK lacks network permissions. |

## User Eligibility Errors

| Error Code | What it means |
| :--- | :--- |
| `userNotEligible` | The user does not meet the rules to join CoinBridge. |
| `sdkNotInitialized` | The SDK isn't ready. Initialize the SDK before calling this. |
| `sdkNotAuthenticated` | The user isn't logged in. Authenticate the user first. |
| `networkError` | The SDK couldn't reach the internet. Check the connection. |

## Create Virtual Card Errors

| Error Code | What it means |
