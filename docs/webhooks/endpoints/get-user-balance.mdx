title: "Get User Balance"
description: "Retrieve the current available balance and currency for a specific user in real-time."
api: "GET /coinbridge/api/v1/user/{userId}/balance"
---

The **Get User Balance** endpoint is a critical data-fetching component used to retrieve a user's currently available balance immediately prior to a transaction. 

This call is triggered by the CoinBridge Backend when a user initiates a `prepareToPay` request from the mobile SDK. Upon successful retrieval, the SDK enables the device's NFC component to proceed with the payment.

### Performance Requirements
As a data-fetching endpoint, this must meet strict performance standards to ensure a smooth user experience:
* **Response Time**: Up to 400ms.
* **SLA**: 99.96% monthly uptime.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the logged-in user in your platform. This ID was synchronized during the [Authentication](/sdk/authentication) process.
</ParamField>

## Response Body

<ResponseField name="amount" type="float" required>
  The current available spending balance for the user.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="currencyCode" type="string" required>
  The 3-letter ISO-4217 currency code of the user balance (e.g., `USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="validUntil" type="string">
  An optional ISO-8601 timestamp in UTC. Indicates how long this balance is considered valid.
  
> **Note:** Transactions received after this timestamp will be rejected without a new preparation process. Use this only if there is a specific business requirement for balance expiration.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "amount": 115.75,
  "currencyCode": "EUR",
  "validUntil": "2025-12-22T14:02:28.137Z"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Security

This request includes a **JSON Web Token (JWT)** signed with the **RS256** algorithm in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix. Your backend must verify the signature using the **RSA public key** provided by CoinBridge during the initial setup.

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authorization** | `Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>` |

### JWT Payload Details

The JWT payload includes specific entries to identify the context of the request:
* **iss**: Set to `CoinBridge`.
* **sub**: Contains the unique `userId` for which the balance is being requested.
* **aud**: The name of your receiving application.
* **exp**: The expiration time, which is typically no later than 1 minute after the issued time (`iat`).
