The CoinBridge solution architecture consists of two primary technological elements: the Mobile SDK and the Back-End Connector. These components work together to enable payments via the NFC/EMV protocol, providing a seamless "Tap & Go" experience.

## CoinBridge Mobile SDK

The **CoinBridge Mobile SDK** is the client-side component designed to reside within any Android or iOS mobile application.

* **Internal e-Wallet**: It functions as an internal e-Wallet, allowing users to make payments over the credit card network.
* **Asset Redemption**: It enables the redemption of virtual assets (such as points, rewards, or virtual currencies) into real currency transactions directly from the mobile app.
* **POS Compatibility**: The SDK enables transactions at any Point of Sale (POS) worldwide that accepts NFC/EMV protocols.
* **Security Management**: It manages device-level security requirements and user authentication flows.

## CoinBridge Back-End Connector

The **CoinBridge Back-End Connector** is the server-side link between your loyalty or user management platform and the CoinBridge platform.

* **Real-Time Assessment**: It allows for dynamic, real-time assessment of user balances and spending policies against transaction requests.
* **Transaction Authorization**: When CoinBridge receives a transaction request, the connector instantly checks spending rules to approve or decline the purchase.
* **Core Processes Supported**:
    * **Eligibility Verification**: Checks if the user is eligible for the service.
    * **Balance Retrieval**: Fetches the user's available balance(s) immediately prior to a transaction.
    * **Policy Retrieval**: Fetches spending rules, such as restrictions on specific Merchant IDs (MIDs) or Category Codes (MCCs).
    * **Data Feedback**: Transmits transaction results (approvals/declines), refund details, and transaction corrections back to your platform.

title: "How the CoinBridge Payment Process Works" 
---
CoinBridge technology enables real-world purchases using digital assets by leveraging the NFC/EMV protocol at any point of sale worldwide. This guide outlines the end-to-end integration of the mobile SDK and webhooks.
### The Integration Process
The integration process consists of four primary phases:
1.  **Authenticate & Verify:** Establish user identity and regulatory eligibility.
2.  **Initialize:** Check the user's current card and wallet status.
3.  **Provision:** Create a virtual card and add it to the device's secure wallet.
4.  **Transact:** Execute payments and sync data via webhooks.

---

### Step 1: Install the SDK
Add the CoinBridge library to your mobile project to enable NFC capabilities.

* **Android:** Update your `build.gradle` file to include the dependency (Minimum API Level 26).
* **iOS:** Add the package via **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** (Minimum iOS 13.4).

---

### Step 2: Authenticate the User 
Secure the connection between your app and the CoinBridge platform.

1.  Create a JSON Web Token on your backend using the **RS256** algorithm.
2.  Use a consistent Unique ID across your mobile app, backend webhooks, and the CoinBridge platform.
3.  Verify the user meets regulatory criteria (e.g., country of residence) before proceeding.
4.  Ensure RSA private keys are stored exclusively on your server; never bundle them in the mobile app.

---

### Step 3: Initialize the SDK
Determine the user's current onboarding state to provide the correct UI flow.

1.  Call the `init` method after the user is authenticated.
2.  Use the returned `hasCard` (Boolean) and `CBPaymentStatus` (Object) to route the user:
    * **If `hasCard` is false:** Direct the user to **Step 4 (Create Card)**.
    * **If `hasCard` is true but no wallet token exists:** Direct the user to **Step 5 (Push to Wallet)**.
    * **If fully setup:** Allow the user to proceed to payment.

### Step 4: Create a Card
Issue a virtual card to act as the bridge between digital assets and the payment terminal.

1.  Call the `IssueCard` method to generate the user's virtual credentials.
2.  Present a form to collect required information (e.g., SSN or National ID) and obtain agreement to Terms & Conditions.
3.  Ensure your backend responds to the CoinBridge issuance webhook to validate user funds and risk policies in real-time.
---

### Step 5: Push to Wallet
Enable "Tap & Go" by adding the virtual card to the device's native secure element.

1.  Enable **Entitlements** (iOS) or **Play Services** (Android) in your project settings.
2.  Trigger Provisioning:
    * **Android:** Call `provisionCard` to add the token to **Google Wallet**.
    * **iOS:** Call `addToApplePay` to add the card to **Apple Wallet**.
3.  Verify that `CBPaymentStatus` now reflects a valid wallet token.

---

### Step 6: Execute Payments (iOS Implementation)
On iOS, a manual trigger is required to launch the payment interface.

1.  Display "Pay Now" Button (Only after the card is successfully provisioned.)
2.  Trigger NFC/EMV protocol when the user taps the button.
3.  Ensure your loyalty platform is ready to respond to real-time requests to verify balances and approve spending rules when the device contacts a POS terminal.

---

### Step 7: Connect the Webhooks
Keep your platform synchronized with real-world spending.

1.  Connect webhooks to the **Transaction Report Endpoint**.
2.  Deduct the appropriate digital assets from the user's account immediately upon receiving a successful transaction report.
3.  Populate the user's in-app transaction history with the data provided by the webhook.
