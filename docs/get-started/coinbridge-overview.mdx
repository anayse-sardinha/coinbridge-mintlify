title: "CoinBridge Overview"
---

CoinBridge is a payment enablement solution that allows users to spend their digital assets such as loyalty points or frequent flyer miles as a standard payment method on their mobile device.

By integrating via SDK and backend webhooks, it facilitates the direct debit of these balances during a transaction, effectively turning "stored value" into immediate purchasing power.

These are the functional pillars:

- **Asset Liquidity**: Converts non-cash balances (miles, points, etc.) into a functional payment tool for the end-user.

- **On-Device Enablement**: Leverages an SDK to establish the payment method directly within the user's device ecosystem.

- **Real-Time Settlement**: Uses backend webhooks to ensure that when a purchase is made, the corresponding balance is instantly drawn from the application’s ledger.

- **Seamless Integration**: Connects the app's existing reward infrastructure to the external payment environment without requiring the user to manually convert points into vouchers.
