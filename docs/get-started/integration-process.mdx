title: "Integration Process" 
---
The integration of the CoinBridge solution is a structured journey that connects your mobile application and back-end infrastructure with the CoinBridge ecosystem. This process ensures a secure, compliant, and seamless "Tap & Go" payment experience for your users.

## Phase 1: Preparation and Prerequisites

Before technical implementation begins, you must establish the necessary accounts and parameters with CoinBridge.

* **Account Setup**: You must contact CoinBridge to create an account for your specific application on the CoinBridge system.
* **Application Parameters**: Provide CoinBridge with your Application Package Name (Android) or Bundle ID (iOS), Team ID, and signing key hashes.
* **Key-Pair Generation**: Generate a unique RSA key pair (at least 2048-bit). Send the public key to CoinBridge; the private key is used by your back-end to sign JWTs for user authentication.
* **Credentials Receipt**: CoinBridge will provide you with a unique Application Key and credentials for a private repository (Gradle for Android, SPM for iOS) to pull the SDK.

## Phase 2: Core Integration Steps

The integration follows a specific lifecycle to move from a standard application to a payment-ready solution.

### 1. SDK Installation and Configuration
* **Import SDK**: Add the CoinBridge SDK dependency to your mobile project using the provided repository credentials.
* **Initialize Configuration**: Call the configuration method in your Application class (Android) or link lifecycle events in your AppDelegate (iOS).
* **Permissions**: Grant mandatory device permissions, including NFC, Internet, and Biometrics, in your app's manifest or property files.

### 2. Back-End Connectivity
* **Endpoint Implementation**: Develop the required data-fetching endpoints (Balance and Eligibility checks) and data-reporting endpoints (Transaction reports) on your platform.
* **Authentication Sync**: Implement the JWT (RS256) signature process on your back-end to allow the SDK to authenticate your users against the CoinBridge platform.

### 3. Implementing the User Journey
* **Account Setup**: Integrate the `isAuthenticated`, `isEligible`, and `Initialization` methods to prepare the user's session.
* **Card Issuance**: Implement the `IssueCard` method to create the user's virtual payment method.
* **Provisioning**: Push the virtual card token to the internal SDK wallet (Android) or Apple Wallet (iOS).

## Phase 3: Launch and Compliance

To move to production, your application must meet specific regulatory and brand requirements.

* **Security Compliance**: Ensure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is active for login and the account lockout policy is implemented.
* **Feature Control**: Implement a server-based feature flag and force-update mechanism to manage the solution's rollout and maintenance.
* **Apple/Android Guidelines**: For iOS, adhere to Apple’s communication and design guidelines, including specific "Add to Wallet" button logic and email notification triggers.
* **Certification**: Cooperate with CoinBridge to complete mandatory certification and system testing.
