The CoinBridge Back-End API v2 utilizes JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure authentication. This mechanism facilitates a smooth and verified data exchange between the CoinBridge backend system and your loyalty or CRM platform.

## The Signature Process

To secure the communication, CoinBridge uses an asymmetric RSA signing process:

1.  **Public Key Provisioning**: Before integration begins, CoinBridge will provide an RSA public key to your back-end development team.
2.  **Signing**: With each outgoing request, the CoinBridge back-end generates and signs a JWT token using its RSA private key.
3.  **Verification**: Your system must use the provided public key to verify the signature of the incoming JWT to ensure the request originated from CoinBridge.

## JWT Structure

### Header
The JWT header specifies the signing algorithm and token type.
```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
alg: RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
typ: JWT
```
### Payload
The payload contains the following standardized claims:

| Claim | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **jti** | A unique identifier for the specific JWT. |
| **iat** | Issued At: The Unix timestamp (in seconds) when the token was created. |
| **exp** | Expiration: Must be no later than 1 minute after the iat time. |
| **aud** | Audience: The name of the receiving application. |
| **iss** | Issuer: This claim is always set to "CoinBridge". |
| **sub** | Subject: The unique UserID for which the request is being made. |

### Implementation Example
CoinBridge provides the signed JWT in the Authorization header of the HTTP request using the Bearer prefix.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <signed_jwt_token>
```
>💡**Note:** While RS256 is the standard, CoinBridge can support alternative authorization types if your back-end architecture requires a specific protocol.
