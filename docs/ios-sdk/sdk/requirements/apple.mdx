To ensure a successful integration of the CoinBridge SDK on iOS, please verify that you meet the following device and administrative prerequisites.

## 1. User Device Requirements
To access the CoinBridge solution, users must have device-level authentication enabled. For this reason, you must set up **Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode**. This requirement enhances Apple Wallet security within the CoinBridge solution.

Without configured authentication, users will experience limitations when accessing or utilizing Apple Wallet features. 

## 2. System & Account Setup
Before beginning the integration of the CoinBridge SDK into your application, you must create an account for the application within the CoinBridge system. 

Please contact the CoinBridge team to verify that the account creation is complete before moving forward.

## 3. Mandatory Implementation Parameters
You must also supply CoinBridge with the following application parameters to complete the setup:

| Category | Required Information |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Identity** | Application Name |
| **App Identifier** | ADAM ID / Apple ID / App ID |
| **Development** | Team ID, Bundle ID, App Groups |
| **Security/APNs** | APNs Key ID, APNs Key File (.p8) |
