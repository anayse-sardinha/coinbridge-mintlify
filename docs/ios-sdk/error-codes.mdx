Errors in the CoinBridge SDK are encapsulated within a `CBError<T>` class. `T` represents the specific error code enum relevant to the method being called. Each error includes a technical description in English to assist with troubleshooting during development.

## Authentication Errors (`AuthError`)

These errors may occur during the `authenticate` method call when synchronizing a user's unique identifier with the CoinBridge backend.

| Error Code | Platform | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `invalidAuthentication` | Android / iOS | Authentication failed, typically due to an invalid JWT or User ID. |
| `alreadyAuthenticated` | Android / iOS | The SDK is already authenticated with a logged-in user. You should proceed to initialization. |
| `authenticationAlreadyStarted`| Android / iOS | An authentication call is already in progress. Wait for the corresponding callback. |
| `networkError` | Android / iOS | The SDK could not access the network due to lack of connectivity or permissions. |
| `generalError` | Android / iOS | An unknown internal error occurred. |

## Initialization Errors (`InitError`)

These errors occur during the asynchronous `init` process while syncing the device with the CoinBridge backend.

| Error Code | Platform | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sdkNotAuthenticated` | Android / iOS | The SDK must be authenticated before calling the initialization method. |
| `deviceNotEligible` | Android / iOS | The device is ineligible for payment (e.g., lacks NFC hardware or is rooted). |
| `deviceNotEligibleNoForegroundPaymentSetting` | Android | NFC tap payments are disabled for the currently opened (foreground) app. |
| `permissionsNotGranted` | Android / iOS | One or more mandatory system permissions were not granted. |
| `configurationNeeded` | Android | The SDK was not properly configured in the `Application` class `onCreate` method. |
| `initAlreadyStarted` | Android / iOS | Initialization is already in progress. Wait for the `OnInitCallback`. |

## Eligibility Errors (`EligibilityError`)

These errors occur when using the `isEligible` method to check if a user meets the criteria to onboard or use CoinBridge services.

| Error Code | Platform | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `userNotEligible` | Android / iOS | The end-user is not eligible to subscribe to CoinBridge services. |
| `sdkNotInitialized` | Android / iOS | You must initialize the SDK before checking eligibility. |
| `invalidRequestData` | Android / iOS | Mandatory data required to calculate eligibility (from the `Get User Info` endpoint) is missing or invalid. |
| `flowAlreadyInProgress` | Android / iOS | An eligibility check is already being processed. |

## Issuing Errors (`IssueCardError`)

These errors occur when manually calling the `issueCard` method to create a virtual card for a user.

| Error Code | Platform | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `paymentAlreadyExists` / `cardAlreadyExists` | Android / iOS | This user already has an assigned virtual card. Check the `hasCard` status in initialization. |
| `issuingFailure` | Android / iOS | The card issuance process failed due to application-specific configurations. |
| `invalidRequestData` | Android / iOS | The payload provided in the `issueCard` method is invalid or missing required user info. |

## Provisioning Errors (`CardProvisioningError` / `CBAddToWalletError`)

These errors occur when pushing an issued card to the mobile wallet (Provisioning).

| Error Code | Platform | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cardNotActive` | Android / iOS | The card exists but is suspended and cannot be added to a wallet. |
| `cardDetailsNotArrived` | Android / iOS | The card exists, but the SDK is still waiting for full payment status details from the backend. |
| `alreadyProvisioned` | Android / iOS | The virtual card is already provisioned to the requested wallet. |
| `userCancelled` | iOS | The user dismissed the Apple "Add to Apple Wallet" form. |
