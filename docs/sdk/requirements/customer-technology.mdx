title: "Customer Technology Requirements"

To integrate the CoinBridge payment service, your infrastructure must meet two core technology prerequisites: a compatible mobile application and a robust loyalty or user management platform.


## Customer Mobile Application

Your existing mobile application serves as the primary interface for the end-user's "Tap & Go" payment experience. To support the CoinBridge SDK, the application must fulfill the following:

* **SDK Implementation**: You must update your existing mobile app to implement the CoinBridge SDK.
* **Feature Support**: Beyond payments, the integrated SDK provides the application with additional services and features.
* **Security Configuration**:
    * **iOS**: Users must configure Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode for secure Apple Wallet access.
    * **Android**: Users must have a passcode, pattern, or fingerprint lock configured to ensure flexible and robust security.
* **Device Compatibility**:
    * **Android**: The solution is incompatible with devices lacking NFC hardware or the ability to pay using the currently open (foreground) application.
    * **iOS**: The SDK is compatible with any iOS mobile application.

## Loyalty or User Management Platform

A back-end platform is required to manage the financial logic and user data that powers the CoinBridge service. This platform performs several essential functions:

* **Real-time Assessment**: It enables the dynamic evaluation of user balances and related spending policies against every transaction request.
* **Transaction Authorization**: The data from your platform is essential for CoinBridge to either approve or decline a purchase.
* **Policy Management**: Your platform manages spending rules, such as Merchant Category Code (MCC) restrictions, Merchant ID (MID) limits, or transaction amount thresholds.
* **Data Exchange**: Your platform must be able to receive transaction details, refund feedback, and correction updates from the CoinBridge platform via the Backend Connector.

## Connectivity Standards (SLA)

Because the connection between CoinBridge and your platform is time-critical, you must meet the following performance standards:

| Requirement | Data-Fetching Endpoints | Data-Reporting Endpoints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Uptime (SLA)** | 99.96% monthly uptime | 99.96% monthly uptime |
| **Response Time** | Up to 400ms | Up to 60s |
| **Criticality** | High (Critical for real-time operations) | Medium (Acknowledging events) |
