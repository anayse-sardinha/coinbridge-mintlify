title: "Card Operation Process"
---

The payment journey is a real-time interaction between your mobile app, the CoinBridge SDK, and the back-end systems. This process enables a "Tap & Go" experience using the NFC/EMV protocol at any point of sale (POS).

---

## Payment Screen Requirements

To ensure a smooth user experience, your main payment screen must include the following elements:

* **Available Balance**: Display the user's balance in the correct currency.
* **Virtual Card Image**: A visual representation of the card following the official style guide.
* **Spending Policies**: Clear notes on any payment restrictions or guidelines.
* **Call to Action (CTA)**: A dedicated "Pay" button.
    * **iOS**: Use the official Apple "Pay with Apple Pay" button.
    * **Android**: Use a prominent CTA button that triggers the biometric prompt.

## The Payment Flow

### Step 1: Prepare to Pay
When the user taps the payment button, the app must notify the SDK to get the NFC component ready.
* **Action**: Call the `prepareToPay` method.
* **Android Note**: You must trigger the system Biometric Prompt *before* calling this method to request fingerprint or face recognition.

### Step 2: NFC Activation
Once the SDK returns a `ReadyToPay` signal, the device is prepared for the tap.
* **iOS**: The user is automatically redirected to the Apple Wallet with the virtual card selected.
* **Android**: The device NFC tool opens to allow communication with the EMV terminal.

### Step 3: The Tap
The user holds their device near the merchant's POS terminal.
* **Technical Detail**: The terminal transmits data via NFC. A successful tap signal only means data was sent; it does not mean the payment is approved yet.

### Step 4: Transaction Resolution
The merchant terminal communicates with the card network (Visa/Mastercard) to authorize the request.
* **Back-End Validation**: The CoinBridge Back-End Connector receives the request and checks the user's real-time balance and spending policies.
* **Decision**: The system determines whether to approve or decline based on fraud, risk, and funds.

---

## Handling Results

The final decision is sent back to your platform via the Back-End Connector. You must then notify the user of the outcome.

* **Approved**: Show a success message along with the transaction amount and merchant name.
* **Declined**: Show a decline message along with the specific reason (e.g., "Insufficient Funds").

> ### 💡 Technical Tip
> If a user cancels the payment or the app decides to stop the process, you must call the `stopPayment` method (on Android) or restart the flow as a new action to reset the SDK state.
