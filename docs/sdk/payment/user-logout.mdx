title: "User Logout"
---

When a user logs out of your application, you must take immediate action to protect their financial data. It is a mandatory requirement to notify the CoinBridge SDK as soon as a logout occurs.

## Mandatory SDK Notification

You must inform the CoinBridge SDK immediately whenever a user logs out of your application. Failing to do so can cause serious issues, such as:
* **Identification Mismatch**: A new user logging into the same device could be incorrectly identified as the previous user.
* **Data Security Risks**: Transaction history and sensitive payment data from the previous user might remain on the device.

## The Logout Process

To handle a logout correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Call the Logout Method**: Use the `logout` method in the CoinBridge SDK as part of your app's logout sequence.
2. **Data Clearance**: Once called, the SDK automatically wipes all user-specific payment data from the device.
3. **Clean State**: This ensures the SDK is completely reset and ready for the next person to log in.

## Important Note on Digital Wallets

While the SDK clears data from your application, it is important to understand how phone wallets behave:
* **Wallet Persistence**: Even after a user logs out of your app, their virtual card might still be active in their phone's digital wallet (like Apple Wallet).
* **Multiple Users**: If different users log into your app using the same phone, you might see multiple virtual cards saved in the phone's system wallet.
