Add the CoinBridge SDK to your mobile app to use our bridge infrastructure. Follow these steps to configure your environment and add the SDK for both Android (Gradle) and iOS (Swift Package Manager).

> **Note:** Before you begin, ensure you have the repository credentials and URL provided by the CoinBridge team.

  <Tab title="Android (Gradle)">
Before starting the integration, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:
* **Credentials**: You must have the repository URL and unique credentials provided by the CoinBridge team.
* **Android**: Minimum SDK version 8.0 (API level 26).

Follow these steps to configure your private Maven repository and dependencies.
1. Create a `coinbridge.properties` file in your project's root folder and add the credentials provided by the CoinBridge team.
> **Note**: Do not commit this file to source control.
2. In your project-level `build.gradle`, add the private Maven repository:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        maven {
            def cbProperties = new Properties()
            cbProperties.load(new FileInputStream(rootProject.file("coinbridge.properties")))
            url = uri(cbProperties['cbpr.url'])
            credentials {
                username = cbProperties['cbpr.user']
                password = cbProperties['cbpr.password']
            }
        }
    }
}
```
3. Add the SDK and the mandatory `doNotStrip` option to your module-level `build.gradle` file to protect native library integrity.
```gradle
android {
    packagingOptions {
        doNotStrip "*/*/libscm.so"
    }
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.coinbridge:cbsdk:x.y.z' // Replace with required version
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="iOS (Swift Package Manager)" >
 Before starting the integration, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:
* **Credentials**: You must have the repository URL and unique credentials provided by the CoinBridge team.
* **iOS**: Xcode 12.5.1 or later and iOS 13.4 or higher.

To add the CoinBridge SDK to your iOS application using Swift Package Manager, follow these steps within Xcode:
1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Navigate to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.
3. Enter the repository URL provided by CoinBridge: https://github.com/CoinBridgeGit/IosSDKSandbox 
4. Follow the prompts to select the version and add it to your app target.
