title: "Wallet Overview"

In the CoinBridge ecosystem, "wallets" refer to the bridge between our backend systems and the physical act of paying at a terminal. Understanding the distinction between internal and external wallets is key to managing the user journey.

CoinBridge uses two wallet types that work together:
| Wallet Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CoinBridge Wallet (Internal)** | A digital entity in our backend that binds the user, their device, and the SDK together. It manages the virtual card metadata. |
| **Device Wallet (External)** | Third-party wallets like **Apple Pay** or **Google Pay**. These store the secure tokens used for contactless payments at physical POS terminals. |

## How Tokenization Secures Your Cards
When a card is transferred to a device wallet, it goes through **Provisioning** using **Tokenization** to protect the real card data.

* **FPAN vs. DPAN**: The actual 16-digit card number (**Funding Primary Account Number**) is replaced by a **Device Primary Account Number (DPAN)**.
* **Visual Identification**: The last four digits shown in Apple/Google Pay will differ from those of the original virtual card.
* **Risk Mitigation**: If a device is lost or a token is compromised, only the specific token (DPAN) is deactivated, keeping the underlying card (FPAN) secure.
