title: "Create a Virtual Card"
---

The `IssueCard` method is the core SDK function that generates the virtual card. Depending on your country's regulations, this process may occur automatically in the background or require additional user data (such as a National ID or SSN).

## Implementation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Additional Data Required
CoinBridge creates the payment method and automatically pushes it to the SDK wallet in the background. No further user action is needed.

### Scenario 2: Additional Data Required
The user must provide specific details (e.g., SSN/National ID) and consent to terms via a dedicated card-issuer form.
> **Note:** You must properly onboard and explain *why* this data is needed to ensure a high onboarding rate.

## Technical Implementation

Call the `issueCard` method from the `CoinBridgeSDK` instance:

```java
CoinBridgeSDK.getInstance().issueCard(activity, new OnIssueCardCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
        // Success: Virtual card issuing flow finalized.
        // Notify the user and redirect to the payment home screen.
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(CBError<IssueCardError> error) {
        // Handle failure (e.g., INVALID_REQUEST_DATA). 
    }

    // Optional UI callbacks if CoinBridge presents a form:
    @Override public void onShown() { } 
    @Override public void onAbandon() { } 
});
```

## UX Guidelines

Card provisioning takes about 10 seconds. Show a loader to keep users in the app until finished; if they leave and the process is interrupted, it will automatically restart once the CoinBridge SDK re-initializes.
