### Transaction Correction Types
Corrections handle edge cases where the final settlement amount differs from the initial tap.

The following table has a summary of the correction cases, these will be discussed further in this page.
| Correction Type | Description | Required Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transaction Cancellation** | A transaction reported as approved was actually declined by the scheme due to a timeout. | **Refund** the user the originally charged amount. |
| **Settlement Diff** | The final amount differs from the initial authorization (e.g., foreign exchange or vending pre-auth). | **Adjust** the balance (Add if lower, Charge if higher). |
| **Expired** | No settlement arrived within 30 days (common for car rentals or abandoned sessions). | **Refund** the held funds back to the user's balance. |
| **Post-Expiration** | Settlement arrived *after* the 30-day expiration period. | **Charge** the user again for the final settlement amount. |


## Correction Scenarios Breakdown

When your backend receives a notification via the **Correction Report Endpoint**, you must act based on the `correctionReason` and the sign of the `correctionAmount`.

* **Negative (-) Amount**: Charge your end-user with this amount.
* **Positive (+) Amount**: Refund your end-user with this amount.

These are the possible correction reasons: 

### Transaction Cancellation
A transaction was initially reported as approved but was actually declined by the card scheme due to a technical error or POS timeout.

> **Action**: Refund the amount that was originally charged from the end-user.

### Settlements Difference 
This happens when the actual settlement amount differs from the original authorization amount.
* **Lower Settlement**: The correction amount is positive. **Refund** the difference to the end-user.
* **Higher Settlement**: The correction amount is negative. **Charge** the additional difference from the end-user.

### Transaction Expired
Settlement has not arrived by the expiration date of the transaction (typically when a pre-authorization is never finalized).

> **Action**: Refund the amount previously charged from the end-user.

### Settlement Post-Expiration
In rare cases, a settlement arrives after the transaction has already expired and been refunded.

> **Action**: Deduct the final settled amount from the end-user's balance again.
