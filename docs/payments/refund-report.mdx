title: "Refund Report"
---

A refund refers to a case where the user has been refunded by the merchant (e.g., returning a product). When a refund occurs, CoinBridge transmits feedback to your platform via the `Refund Report Endpoint`.

These are the characteristics of a refund report:
* **Independent Status**: The refund appears as an independent transaction with a unique transaction ID.
* **Status**: The status for a refund transaction is always "Approved".
* **Amount**: The refund amount will always be a non-negative (positive) value.

### Action Required
1.  **Credit Account**: Top-up the end-user's account balance by the positive refund amount.
2.  **Correlate (Optional)**: If historical transaction data is available, CoinBridge will provide the `originalTransactionId` to help you link the refund to the original purchase.
3.  **History**: Update the transaction history to show the refund and the original transaction ID if available.
