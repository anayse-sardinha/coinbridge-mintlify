title: "Transaction Report"

Receive real-time feedback on transaction results to update user balances and transaction history.

The Transaction Report endpoint is a mandatory webhook used by the CoinBridge backend to notify your platform of a transaction's final resolution. Because CoinBridge operates as a debit service, we deduct funds from the application’s global balance immediately upon approval. You must use this report to synchronize your internal user records with the actual transaction outcome.

## Handle Transaction Feedback

When a user taps their device at a Point of Sale (POS), the merchant's terminal communicates with the Mastercard or Visa network. CoinBridge receives this request, evaluates it against the user’s balance and spending policies, and returns a resolution. 

Immediately after this decision, CoinBridge sends a `POST` request to your Transaction Report endpoint.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Receive the report**: Check for the incoming `TransactionReportDTO` at your endpoint.
2. **Verify the result**: Confirm the `approved` status within the `transaction` object.
3. **Process the balance**:
    * **Approved Transaction**: Charge the transaction amount from the end-user’s account balance. 
    * **Declined Transaction**: Do not charge the user. Capture the `declineReason` to explain the failure.
4. **Update History**: Reflect the transaction status, merchant name, and amount in the user's transaction history.
