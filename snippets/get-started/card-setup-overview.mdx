title: "Card Setup Overview"
---

Setting up a digital card involves a specific sequence of steps to prepare the SDK and the user's device for **Tap & Go** payments. Unlike day-to-day interactions, this "Happy Path" is a one-time onboarding process for new users.

<Note>
Wait for each method's callback before proceeding to the next step.
</Note>

### [Prerequisites](docs/get-started/to-start)
Before starting, you need to:
* **Generate RSA Key-Pair**: Create a 2048-bit RSA key pair and share the public key with CoinBridge.
* **Import SDK**: Add the CoinBridge SDK to your project (Gradle for Android, SPM for iOS).
* **Set Permissions**: Enable Internet, NFC, and Biometric permissions in your app.

See the required steps for setup below:

### 1. [Authenticate](docs/sdk/installation/authentication) 
To begin, call `authenticate()` with a server-side generated JWT to sync the user with the SDK. Only call this if `isAuthenticated()` returns `false`.
<Note>
The SDK persists authentication until logout, so you only need to authenticate once per session.
</Note>

### 2. [Initialize](docs/sdk/installation/initialize)
Call `initialize()` every app launch to sync with the backend and get a `hasCard` boolean that determines your next step.

### 3. [Create a Digital Card](docs/sdk/installation/issue-card)
If `hasCard` is `false`, call `issueCard()` to create the payment credential. Users may need to provide additional information based on local regulations.

### 4. [Add to Wallet (Provisioning)](docs/sdk/installation/add-to-wallet)
Call `provisionCard()` to push the card token to the device's native wallet. Once `TokenStatus` is `ACTIVE`, the device is ready for payments.

### 5. Logout 
When a user logs out of your application, you must call the `logout` method.
