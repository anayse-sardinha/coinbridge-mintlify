To follow financial regulations and keep the payment process safe, your app must meet these mandatory security requirements.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

CoinBridge requires MFA during login to protect sensitive account data. Your login process must to include two separate steps:

* **Step 1**: A username and password that meet specific complexity rules.
* **Step 2**: A one-time passcode (OTP) sent to the user through SMS or email.

<Note>
  If your app uses a different login method, please reach out to the CoinBridge team to make sure it's supported.
</Note>

## Account Lockout Policy

To stop anyone from trying to guess passwords, your app must automatically lock an account after **five failed login attempts** in a row. This is a way to protect your users from unauthorized access.

## Feature Flags
You need to set up a server-side "feature flag" so you can control CoinBridge features remotely. This provides:

* **Remote Control**: You can turn the payment features on or off without needing to push a new version of your app to the store.
* **Flexible Launch**: You can choose exactly when to "go live" after your app is already in the hands of users.

<Tip>
  If you ever need to turn the feature off, remember to show a friendly message so users know the service is just temporarily unavailable.

## Force Update Feature

A "Force Update" tool is required to make sure everyone is using the most recent version of your application. This ensures every user has the latest security patches and SDK updates, which prevents bugs and keeps the payment system running smoothly.

## Device Security

For security on Android, users need to have a secure lock method set up on their phone to use the payment features:
* Passcode
* Pattern
* Fingerprint
