title: "Transaction Results & History"

Understanding how transactions are authorized and reported is key to providing a transparent experience for your users. Once a user taps their device, the system evaluates the request in real-time to determine if the purchase is approved.

## 1. General Resolution Process

After a transaction attempt is made at a merchant’s terminal, the following steps occur:

1.  **Transmission**: The merchant’s EMV terminal sends the transaction request through the Visa or Mastercard network.
2.  **Authorization**: The CoinBridge Back-End Connector receives the request.
3.  **Verification**: The platform compares the transaction details against the user’s available balance and your specific spending policies.
4.  **Decision**: The Back-End determines whether to approve or decline the purchase.
5.  **Feedback**: The decision is communicated instantly to your loyalty or user management platform.

## 2. Transaction Notifications

Notifications keep users informed about their spending in real-time. 

### System Notifications
For iOS users, Apple Wallet provides real-time updates and alerts about card activity. These appear on the lock screen or in the notification center and include the merchant’s name and transaction amount.

### Suggested App Notifications
We recommend using in-app push notifications or pop-ups to confirm the transaction resolution. While optional, these should include:
* **Approved**: A success message with the transaction amount and merchant name.
* **Declined**: A clear indication that the payment failed, including the specific reason provided by the system.

## 3. Standard Decline Reasons

When a transaction is declined, the CoinBridge Back-End sends a specific code and description. You should map these to user-friendly messages in your app.

| Decline Reason Code | User-Friendly Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `INSUFFICIENT_END_USER_FUNDS` | Transaction exceeds your available balance. |
| `MCC_NOT_ALLOWED` | This category of merchant is restricted under your policy. |
| `MID_NOT_ALLOWED` | This specific merchant is not allowed. |
| `COUNTRY_NOT_ALLOWED` | Payments in this country are restricted. |
| `AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_THRESHOLD` | Transaction exceeds the maximum allowed amount. |
| `CB_SYSTEM_ERROR` | An unexpected system error occurred. Please try again. |

## 4. Transaction History Best Practices

A dedicated transaction history screen allows users to review their past activity. 

* **Status Differentiation**: Use colors or icons to clearly distinguish between approved and declined transactions.
* **Detailed View**: For each entry, provide the merchant name, date, time, and full amount.
* **Apple Pay Compliance**: Apple requires that any transaction made using the Apple Wallet be marked with an official Apple Pay indicator to ensure transparency.
* **Refunds & Corrections**: Always show the source of a refund or adjustment. Transaction corrections will include the Original Transaction ID so users can track updates to previous purchases.
