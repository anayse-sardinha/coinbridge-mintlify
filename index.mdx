**CoinBridge transforms your loyalty program into a universal payment instrument.**

We provide the infrastructure to convert closed-loop loyalty assets (points, miles, rewards) into open-loop spendable currency. By integrating the CoinBridge SDK, you enable your users to spend their points directly at millions of merchants worldwide—online and in-store—without requiring any integration from the merchant side.
